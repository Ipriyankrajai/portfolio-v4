Building a portfolio is an essential step for any developer. It's not just about showcasing your work; it's about demonstrating your skills and personality.

## Choosing the Stack

For this version of my portfolio, I chose Next.js for its powerful features like server-side rendering and static site generation. Tailwind CSS was a natural choice for styling, allowing for rapid development and consistent design.

## Design Philosophy

I wanted a clean, minimalist design that puts the focus on the content. I used a dark theme to reduce eye strain and give the site a modern feel. Animations were added using Framer Motion to make the user experience more engaging.

## Performance Optimization

Performance was a top priority. I optimized images using the Next.js Image component and used code splitting to ensure fast load times. Accessibility was also a key consideration, ensuring that the site is usable by everyone.

## Conclusion

Building this portfolio was a rewarding experience. It allowed me to experiment with new technologies and refine my skills. I hope this post inspires you to build your own portfolio!
