React Hooks have revolutionized how we write React components. They allow us to use state and other React features without writing a class.

## useState

The `useState` hook is the most basic hook. It allows you to add state to your functional components.

```jsx
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

## useEffect

The `useEffect` hook lets you perform side effects in functional components. It serves the same purpose as `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` in React classes.

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
}, [count]);
```

## Custom Hooks

One of the most powerful features of hooks is the ability to create your own. Custom hooks allow you to extract component logic into reusable functions.

```jsx
function useWindowSize() {
  const [size, setSize] = useState({ width: 0, height: 0 });

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleResize = () => {
      setSize({ width: window.innerWidth, height: window.innerHeight });
    };

    window.addEventListener("resize", handleResize);
    handleResize();

    return () => window.removeEventListener("resize", handleResize);
  }, []);

  return size;
}
```

## Conclusion

Mastering hooks is essential for any modern React developer. They provide a cleaner and more concise way to write components and manage state.
