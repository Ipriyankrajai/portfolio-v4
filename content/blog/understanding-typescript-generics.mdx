Generics are one of the most powerful features of TypeScript. They allow you to create reusable components that work with a variety of types rather than a single one.

## What are Generics?

Generics allow you to define a component that can work over a variety of types rather than a single one. This allows users to consume these components and use their own types.

## Why use Generics?

Generics provide a way to create reusable code components. They also provide type safety without compromising on flexibility.

## Example

Here is a simple example of a generic function:

```typescript
function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
  return arg;
}

// Usage
const num = identity<number>(42);
const str = identity<string>("hello");
```

## Generic Interfaces

You can also use generics with interfaces:

```typescript
interface Container<T> {
  value: T;
  getValue(): T;
}

class Box<T> implements Container<T> {
  constructor(public value: T) {}

  getValue(): T {
    return this.value;
  }
}
```

## Generic Constraints

Sometimes you want to limit the types that can be used with a generic:

```typescript
interface Lengthwise {
  length: number;
}

function logLength<T extends Lengthwise>(arg: T): T {
  console.log(arg.length);
  return arg;
}

logLength("hello"); // Works - strings have length
logLength([1, 2, 3]); // Works - arrays have length
// logLength(42);     // Error - numbers don't have length
```

## Conclusion

Generics are a fundamental part of TypeScript. Understanding them will allow you to write more flexible and robust code.
